Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA KC705
Xilinx Vivado 2017.1 or later.

The project file to open
---------------------------------------------
For example, to open the trojan_4 - inserted Leon3 design, follow the commands:

cd ./trojan_4_Jump_Disabling/designs/leon3-xilinx-kc705/vivado/leon3-xilinx-kc705/
vivado leon3-xilinx-kc705.xpr

More info
--------------
For other trojans, open their corresponding .xpr file.
The design is already placed, routed and bitstream is also generated to be loaded to the FPGA.
You can run your cross-compiled programs (for SPARC architecture) in Leon3 by using a grmon debug monitor.
